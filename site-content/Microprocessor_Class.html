<p>With the fall semester and Christmas now out of the way, I finally have time to write a bit about what I worked on last semester.  My favorite class last semester was Microprocessor System Design and, so far, has been my favorite ECE (electrical and computer engineering) class in general.  The class was based on the mbed microcontroller.  During the class we completed seven assignments that walked us through how to use many of mbed classes that make interfacing C code to the physical world simple.  In addition to using the mbed classes, for our final assignment we used none of the mbed classes.  Instead we used direct register access to manipulate the pins of the mbed.</p>
<p>Many of the topics covered in the first few assignments I was already familiar with through my prior Arduino experience;  however, it was refreshing to receive formal instruction on the things that I had learned from online tutorials and forum chatter.  Not only did this fill in gaps in my understanding and correct misconceptions but applying what I had already learned to a new embedded platform, the mbed itself, greatly expanded what I already knew about embedded system development.</p>
